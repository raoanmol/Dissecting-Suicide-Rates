# Dissecting Suicide Rates: A Data Analysis

This project uses the [Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) dataset to analyze global suicide rates and answer the following questions:

- How many people lost their lives to suicide each year?
- Which gender is more likely to commit suicide?
- Which age group tends to have the most victims?
- How are suicide rates related to the GDP per Capita?
- What are the average suicide rates across generations over time?
- When was this issue at its peak?

## Graphs

Here are some graphs generated by the project:
1. ![Annual Suicides Globally](./graphs/suicides_over_time.png)
   
   This line graph shows the total number of suicides globally each year.

2. ![Net Suicides by Gender](./graphs/suicides_by_gender.png)

   This bar graph illustrates the total number of suicides by gender.

3. ![Net Suicides by Age](./graphs/suicides_by_age.png)

   This bar graph shows the total number of suicides by age group.

4. ![Average Suicide Rates vs. GDP per Capita](./graphs/suicides_vs_gdp.png)

   This scatter plot shows the correlation between average suicide rates and GDP per capita.

5. ![Average Suicide Rates Over Time by Generation](./graphs/suicides_over_time_generation.png)

   This line graph presents the average suicide rates over time, split by generation.

6. ![Suicides by Year and Age Group](./graphs/suicides_by_year_and_age.png)

   This 3D surface plot shows the suicide rates by year and age group.
